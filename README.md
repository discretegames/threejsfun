# [Three.js Fun](https://discretegames.github.io/threejsfun/)

Playing around with shapes, colors, lighting, and random distributions in [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) on GitHub pages: [discretegames.github.io/threejsfun](https://discretegames.github.io/threejsfun)

Inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/Q7AOvWpIVHU) with help from
[this](https://threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-primitives.html) and
[this](https://datagenetics.com/blog/january32020/index.html).

Try it yourself with:

```text
git clone https://github.com/discretegames/threejsfun.git
cd threejsfun
npm i
npm run dev
```

It should auto-open a url like <http://localhost:3002/threejsfun/> with the rotating 3D shapes.

<!-- Deploy:
npm run build
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
-->
